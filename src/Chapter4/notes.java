    Introducing Inheritance

    The word inheritance conjures up several noncomputer meanings:
    A class that’s based on another class is said to inherit the other class.
    A derived class automatically takes on all the behavior and attributes of its base class
    A derived class can add features to the base class it inherits by defining its own methods and fields.
    A derived class can also change the behavior provided by the base class
    Inheritance is best used to implement is-a-type-of relationships
    
   
    
    
    Inheritance hierarchies
    
    One of the most important aspects of inheritance is that a class derived from a 
    base class can in turn be used as the base class for another derived class
    All classes ultimately derive from a Java class named Object
    
    

    
    Creating Subclasses
    
    The basic procedure for creating a subclass is simple: You just use the extends
    keyword on the declaration for the subclass
    public class ClassName extends BaseClass
{
 // class body goes here
}
    public class BouncingBall extends Ball bouncing ball comes from the ball class
    A subclass inherits all the members from its base class
    You can’t access from the subclass methods or fields that are declared in the base class as private.
    

    
    Overriding Methods
  
    If a subclass declares a method that has the same signature as a public method of 
    the base class, the subclass then over rides the base class
