    inner class
    
    You can create a class within a class called a inner class and this inner class
    has all the atrabutes of the outer class even when you set it to private
    you can set it to private,staticc or protected. 
   e.g. class outerClassName
{
 private class innerClassName
 {
 // body of inner class
 }
}
    
    
  static inner class
    
    A static inner class is similar to an inner class but doesn’t require an instance of the 
    outer class. 
    Like a static method, a static inner class can’t access any nonstatic fields or methods in its outer class.
    It can access static fields or methods.
   
    
    
    anonymous class
    
    An anonymous class is a class that’s defined on the spot,at the point where 
    you want to instantiate it. Because you code the body of the class right where you 
    need it, you don’t have to give it a name.
    
    the basic form of declaring and instansiating a anonymouse class is,
    new ClassOrInterface() { class-body }
