    //What is Object Oriantated Programming
    
    //a type of computer programming based on the premise that all programs are essentially computer-based simulations of 
    //real-world objects or abstract concepts.
    
    //Objects have identity
    
    //every occurrence of a particular type of object — called an instance
    //object-oriented programming, each object has its own location in the computer’s memory
    //Java objects have something called a hash code, which is an int value
    
    
    //Objects have type

    //object-oriented programming lets you assign names to the different kinds of objects in a program. In Java
    // the object is of the type specified by the class
    
    
    //Objects have state
    
    
    //The type of an object determines what attributes the object has.
    //The combination of the values for all the attributes of an object is called the object’s state
    //Unlike its identity, an object’s state can — and usually does — change over its lifetime
    
    
    //Objects have behavior
    
    //Another characteristic of objects is that they have behavior, which means that they can do things.
    //In Java, the behavior of an object is provided by its methods
    
  
    //Understanding the Life Cycle of an Object

    // Before an object can be created from a class, the class must be loaded
    //An object is created from a class when you use the new keyword
    //The object lives its life, providing access to its public methods and fields to whoever wants and needs them
    // When it’s time for the object to die, the object is removed from memory, and Java drops its internal reference to it.
    
    
    //Working with Related Classes
    
    //The real power of object oriented programming, however, lies in its ability to create classes that describe closely related objects.
    //Java has two object-oriented programming features that are designed specifically to handle classes that are related this way: inheritance and interfaces
    

    //Inheritance
    
    //inheritance is an object-oriented programming technique that lets you use one class as the basis for another.
    //you can add methods and fields that define data and behavior that’s unique to the subclass.
    //You could use inheritance to solve the baseball/softball problem
    //One way to think of inheritance is as a way to implement is-a-type-of relationships. 
    
    
    //Interfaces
    
    
    //An interface is a set of methods and fields that a class must provide to implement the interface.
    //Then a class that implements the interface provides code for each of the methods the interface defines
    //A class can have only one base class, but a class can implement as many interfaces as necessary
    

    //Designing a Program with Objects
    
    //An object-oriented program usually isn’t just a single object
    //one should compile a program in tiers or diffrent classes so everything is manageble there are useally 3 methods
    //1. Presintation layer
    //2.Logic layer
    //3. Database layer 
    
    
    //Diagramming Classes with UML
    
    //most programmers use a standard called UML, which stands for Unified Modeling Language
